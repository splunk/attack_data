A Repository of curated datasets from various attacks to:

* Easily develop detections without having to build an environment from scratch or simulate an attack.
* Test detections, specifically [Splunks Security Content](https://github.com/splunk/security-content)
* [Replay](#replay-datasets-) into streaming pipelines for validating your detections in your production SIEM

# Installation
Notes:
* These steps are inteded to be ran on your actual Splunk host/server (not remotely)

GitHub LFS is used in this project. For Mac users git-lfs can be derived with homebrew (for another OS click [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation)):

````
brew install git-lfs
````

Then you need to install it. I would recommend using the --skip-smudge parameter, which will avoid that all Git LFS files are downloaded during git clone. You can install it with the following command:

````
git lfs install --skip-smudge
````

Download the repository with this command:

````
git clone https://github.com/splunk/attack_data
````

Fetch all or select attack data sets

````
# This pulls all data - Warning >9Gb of data
git lfs pull

# This pulls one data set directory
git lfs pull --include=datasets/attack_techniques/T1003.001/atomic_red_team/

# Or pull just one log like this
git lfs pull --include=datasets/attack_techniques/T1003.001/atomic_red_team/windows-sysmon.log

# Anatomy of a Dataset üß¨
### Datasets
Datasets are defined by a common YML structure. The structure has the following fields:

|field| description|
|---|---|
| id | UUID of dataset |
|name  | name of author  |
| date  | last modified date  |
| dataset  | array of URLs where the hosted version of the dataset is located  |
| description | describes the dataset as detailed as possible |
| environment |  markdown filename of the environment description see below |
| technique | array of MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with dataset |
| references | array of URLs that reference the dataset |
| sourcetypes | array of sourcetypes that are contained in the dataset |


For example

### Environments

Environments are a description of where the dataset was collected. At this moment there are no specific restrictions, although we do have a simple [template](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/blob/master/environments/TEMPLATE.md) a user can start with here. The most common environment for most datasets will be the [attack_range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/blob/master/environments/attack_range.md) since this is the tool that used to generate attack data sets automatically.

# Replay Datasets üìº
Most datasets generated will be raw log files. There are two main simple ways to ingest it.

### Into Splunk


##### using replay.py
pre-requisite, clone, create virtual env and install python deps:

```
git clone git@github.com:splunk/attack_data.git
cd attack_data
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r bin/requirements.txt
```

0. Download dataset 
1. configure [`bin/replay.yml`](/bin/replay.yml) 
2. run `python bin/replay.py -c bin/replay.yml`


##### using UI

0. Download dataset
1. In Splunk enterprise , add data -> Files & Directories -> select dataset
2. Set the sourcetype as specified in the YML file
3. Explore your data

See a quick demo üì∫ of this process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41NAG0zGg40).

### Into DSP

To send datasets into DSP the simplest way is to use the [scloud](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DSP/1.1.0/Admin/AuthenticatewithSCloud) command-line-tool as a requirement.

1. Download the dataset
2. Ingest the dataset into DSP via scloud command `cat attack_data.json | scloud ingest post-events --format JSON
3. Build a pipeline that reads from the firehose and you should see the events.

# Contribute Datasets ü•∞

1. Generate a dataset
2. Under the corresponding MITRE Technique ID folder create a folder named after the tool the dataset comes from, for example: `atomic_red_Team`
3. Make PR with <tool_name_yaml>.yml file under the corresponding created folder, upload dataset into the same folder.

See [T1003.002](datasets/attack_techniques/T1003.003/atomic_red_team/) for a complete example.

Note the simplest way to generate a dataset to contribute is to launch your simulations in the attack_range, or manually attack the machines and when done dump the data using the [dump function](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#dump-log-data-from-attack-range).

See a quick demo üì∫ of the process to dump a dataset [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnD0BtjCILs).

To contribute a dataset simply create a PR on this repository, for general instructions on creating a PR [see this guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

# Automatically generated Datasets ‚öôÔ∏è

This project takes advantage of automation to generate datasets using the attack_range. You can see details about this service on this [sub-project folder attack_data_service](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/tree/master/attack_data_service).

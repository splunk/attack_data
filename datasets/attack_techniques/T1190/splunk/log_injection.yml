description: An attacker can use a specially crafted web URL in their browser to cause log file injection, in which the attack inserts American National Standards Institute (ANSI) escape codes into specific files using a terminal program that supports those escape codes. The attack requires a terminal program that supports the translation of ANSI escape codes and requires additional user interaction to successfully execute.

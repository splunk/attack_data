description: An attacker can use a specially crafted web URL in their browser to cause
  log file injection, in which the attack inserts American National Standards Institute
  (ANSI) escape codes into specific files using a terminal program that supports those
  escape codes. The attack requires a terminal program that supports the translation
  of ANSI escape codes and requires additional user interaction to successfully execute.
